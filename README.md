# C3LLS: Deep Learning Cellular 3D Laboratory Labeling System
Welcome to C3LLS, an open-source semi-automatated approach for researchers with limited AI expertise to create their own model for organoid, nuclear, and cell segmentation! 

C3LLS can
\n 1. Count nuclei in an organoid
2. Count the percentage of dead nuclei in an organoid
		3. Quantify the cell surface marker expression of an independent cell, a cell in an organoid, or an entire organoid
