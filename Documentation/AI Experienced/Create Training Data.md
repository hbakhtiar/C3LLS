## Customizable Training Data

A primary limitation of 3D organoid segmentation models is building a robust, diverse training dataset. This typically involves manual segmentation which is exceedingly time-consuming.

C3LLS gets around this by leveraging a computational approach to quickly make a dataset-specific training dataset. 

## Using C3LLS to Make Training Data

C3LLS lets users create dataset-specific training data. This is done using a semi-automated algorithm with adjustable parameters. To get started:

1. Place your training images into a folder of your choice. I recommend using one image from each experimental condition or cell line.
2.
