## Customizable Training Data

A primary limitation of 3D organoid segmentation models is building a robust, diverse training dataset. This typically involves manual segmentation which is exceedingly time-consuming.

C3LLS gets around this by leveraging a computational approach to quickly make a dataset-specific training dataset. 

## Using C3LLS to Make Training Data

C3LLS lets users create dataset-specific training data. This is done using a semi-automated algorithm with adjustable parameters. To get started follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/hbakhtiar/C3LLS/blob/main/Documentation/New%20to%20AI/Create%20Training%20Data.md#Step-By-Step) on creating a training dataset
